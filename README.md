# mazes

I'm working through Jamis Buck's [Mazes for
Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers).

I'm a Clojure newb, so this is not likely to be fantastic code.

## Examples

Fire up your REPL:

    $ lein repl

To print a 10-by-10 grid with no links between any cells:

    mazes.core=> (require 'mazes.repr.ascii)
    mazes.core=> (mazes.repr.ascii/print-grid (make-grid 3 3))

That'll give you something like this:

    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+

To run the binary tree maze generation algorithm on a 5-by-10 grid:

    mazes.core=> (require 'mazes.alg.binary-tree)
    mazes.core=> (def maze (mazes.alg.binary-tree/on (make-grid 5 10)))
    mazes.core=> (mazes.repr.ascii/print-grid maze)

That'll give you something slightly (but only slightly) more impressive:

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |                                       |
    +   +   +---+   +---+   +---+   +   +   +
    |   |   |       |       |       |   |   |
    +---+---+---+   +---+---+---+   +   +   +
    |               |               |   |   |
    +---+---+   +   +---+   +---+   +---+   +
    |           |   |       |       |       |
    +   +   +---+---+   +   +---+   +   +   +
    |   |   |           |   |       |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
